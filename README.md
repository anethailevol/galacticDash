# Galactic Dash
Galactic Dash is a space themed platformer game based on popular platformer games such as Geometry Dash and Moto X3M. The user’s goal is to navigate a spaceship through the galaxy to reach their destination. First, the user will be asked their name, so their score can be stored to make the leaderboard. The spaceship will continuously move to the right; it can be moved up and down, bounce off certain objects, and will have to dodge certain obstacles. If the spaceship makes contact with certain obstacles, the spaceship will be destroyed, and the level will end; they will have an option to redo the level. Each level will be timed, and the user will receive a certain number of stars depending on how fast they complete the level. At the end, the game will show a leaderboard compiled with all the scores of all the players who have played the game.
